# Medical Stock Management System – Backend
## Project Summary

The Medical Stock Management System (Backend) is a RESTful web service developed using Spring Boot to manage medicine inventory data efficiently. It provides a secure and structured backend that supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for medical stock management.

The backend handles all business logic, database interactions, and API endpoints required by the frontend application. It stores medicine details such as name, manufacturer, quantity, price, and expiry date in a relational database and exposes REST APIs to create, retrieve, update, and delete medicine records.

This backend system ensures data consistency, reduces manual errors, and enables real-time interaction between the frontend and database.

## Backend Features

RESTful APIs for medicine stock management
Create new medicine records
Retrieve all medicine details from the database
Update existing medicine information
Delete expired or incorrect medicine records
Centralized business logic and validation
Smooth integration with frontend using HTTP requests

## Technologies Used (Backend)

Java
Spring Boot
Spring Web (REST API)
Spring Data JPA
Hibernate
MySQL
Maven

## CRUD Operations (Backend APIs)

Create: Add medicine details to database
Read: Fetch medicine stock data
Update: Modify quantity, price, or expiry date
Delete: Remove expired or unwanted medicine entries

## Future Enhancement

The backend can be extended with the following improvements:
Authentication and authorization using JWT
Role-based access control (Admin / Pharmacist)
Automatic expiry and low-stock alerts
Audit logs for stock updates
Advanced search and filter APIs
